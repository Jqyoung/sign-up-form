# sign-up-form
From [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form), a sign-up form created using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS with the ability to validate the input fields as well as check if the passwords match.

## What I learned

* Creating, organizing and styling form in HTML and CSS
* Designing intuitive forms for the user
